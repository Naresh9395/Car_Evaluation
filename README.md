# Car_Evaluation
The attached dataset is a imbalanced data set and we have 6 independent variables and one dependent variable which is categorical
In this project we need to categerize the car, depends on its features present in the dataset.
I have done some regular parctices like to find some ststistical summary of the data set, and the data types of each column etc.
I have done some Explorartory data analysis
As this is the imbalanced data set i have performed some SMOTE technique to balance data.
After that i have applied all classification models with and with out SMOTE thechnique and observed accuracy, confusion matrices, crrosstab and classification reports.
I found Logistic regeression gave very less accuracy so that i have done hyper parameter tuning for that algorithm
